            <b>In other words</b>, Crewmates is an app that assigns chores to
            you and your household members on a weekly basis. Weeks start on a
            Monday (the earliest) and always end on a Friday.

            <b>In other words</b>, all you need to do is input your recurring
            house chores and every Monday just click on "Create week" and
            Crewmates will randomly assign tasks to the members of your crew.
            It's random, but it distributes chores as equally as possible.
