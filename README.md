# Welcome to CrewMates !! ![](src/assets/parrot-flying-small.png)

## Introduction

Crew Mates is an application that assigns chores to you and your household members on a weekly basis. Weeks start on Mondays and always end on Fridays (No chores on weekends üòâ).

Once logged in, you can create a group for you and your flatmates and list
your recurring weekly house chores. Every week, at the click of a button Crewmates will randomly assign all the tasks on your recurring tasks list for the week to your crew. It's random, but it distributes chores as equally as possible.

Finally, during the week just mark your tasks as done and that's it!

## Team & Contributors

### Airam Santos

Technology, and especially the world of video games, has always been
a part of my life. Years ago, I studied massage therapy, but later
realized it wasn‚Äôt fulfilling. It wasn‚Äôt until I moved to Barcelona
from Tenerife about 4 years ago that I decided to pursue what I
truly loved, which is why I made a career shift and began studying
web development. Currently, I work and study while aiming to keep
learning so I can dedicate myself to my passions: web development
and traveling the world.

### Andrea Bronzoni

I‚Äôve always loved technology. As a teenager, I learned languages,
which led me to travel and, 7 years ago, to move from Italy to
Spain. A year ago, I decided to pursue my passion and trained as a
Fullstack MERN Developer at Ironhack. I love learning and creating
high-quality solutions. I also enjoy video games üéÆ, Italian cooking
üçù, soccer ‚öΩ, and traveling ‚úàÔ∏è.
